<h1>The Leaner Report</h1>

<p>The purpose of this report is to note which media outlets are “leaning” toward which candidate to better understand the basis of their reporting.</p>

</header>

<main>

<h2>Major Networks</h2>

<div class="entity">
<h3>ABC</h3>
<p>Initially all-in for Jeb Bush because of the Florida connection between the ex-Florida Governor and major Disney (ABC parent company) interests in Florida. The network can go either way with much negative coverage of Trump by Tom Llamas who has been called out in public by Trump. This is offset with an uneven coverage of Clinton, much of it also negative.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>CBS</h3>
<p>All-in for Hillary probably because of long association of the network with CIA which supports Hillary. This cozy relationship has been exaggerated of late with a 60 Minutes report on the agency done mostly by operatives of the agency – a low point for 60 Minutes reporting. This was followed by the hiring of ex-CIA Deputy Director (who has since quit), Mike Morrell, who actually endorsed Clinton. Lots of cool Trump bashing done with a slick touch.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>NBC</h3>
<p>All-in for Hillary. With older connections to General Electric, the network maintains close ties with the Democratic Party. The most blatantly slanted network.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Fox News</h3>
<p>Seemingly reluctant supporters of Trump. Support varies from host to host with Sean Hannity all-in for Trump to an extreme. This is somewhat odd since he is personal friends with George Bush. The Bush family, led by Matriarch Barbara, dislikes Trump because of his actions during the primaries when Jeb was quickly eliminated. There is some leaked email evidence that Meg Kelly and O’Reilly may be Hillary supporters.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>MSNBC</h3>
<p>Clinton skeptical, but solid and sincere hate for Donald Trump to the point of being ridiculous. Many of the hosts would have preferred Bernie Sanders. More Progressive ideals than the NBC folks.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>PBS</h3>
<p>Trying the hardest to remain neutral but long-standing liberal bias creeps in to coverag Hosts often seem befuddled by the events. The two supposedly balanced commentators Brooks and Shields both hate Trump.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>CNN</h3>
<p>Very negative almost abusive anti-Trump bias to point of hate. Very unprofessional in most instances. Don Lemon is the worst offender.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>RT</h3>
<p>Tries to appear neutral but Moscow based programming leans towards Trump while American-based programming is inclined to promote Hillary. Of late the pro-Hillary bias is toned down, probably by the home office.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>France 24</h3>
<p>Appears neutral with a Trump skepticism.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Deutsche Welle</h3>
<p>DW seems to parrot American mainstream media and the result is a poorly defined anti-Trump bias.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>CSPAN</h3>
<p>Very neutral. Soft with both candidates. Not a player in terms of influence.</p>
</div>

<h2>Intelligence Agencies</h2>

<div class="entity">
<h3>CIA</h3>
<p>The CIA is all-in for Hillary. The No Agenda Show has discussed this on the show many times. The reason for this is undefined. It is rumored that the rank-and-file prefer Trump. Hard ass one-time CIA director James Woolsey joined Trump team.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>NSA</h3>
<p>Seen as a possible source of DNC document leaks and possible hacks. Cozy with FBI lately. The best guess for this incredibly secretive operation is pro-Trump.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>State</h3>
<p>This most secretive and rather small operation should be pro-Hillary. But impossible to get a read.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>DIA</h3>
<p>An under-discussed agency with great power. The fact that the former Director of the DIA, General Flynn works for the Trump campaign may tell us something.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>FBI</h3>
<p>The head of the FBI is a Republican and seems to be walking a tightrope. The best guess is that the Agency is pro-Trump.</p>
</div>

<h2>Talk Radio Major Hosts</h2>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Savage</h3>
<p>Incredibly pro-Trump and Trump is on his show a lot.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Limbaugh</h3>
<p>May have been the first major talk show host to go pro-Trump. Recently called Hillary a reptile.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Hannity</h3>
<p>All-in to an extreme for Trump. Ludicrous boosterism.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Levin</h3>
<p>Never liked Trump, but defends him from media abuse. Wanted Ted Cruz to run and still wants Ted Cruz.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Hartman</h3>
<p>Never liked Hillary but will support her. He wanted Bernie Sanders. Hates Trump.</p>
</div>

<h2>Major Newspapers with National Reach</h2>

<i>All of these papers are pro-Hillary and all will recommend you vote for her. A paper-by-paper run down may be included in a future Leaner Report. All the editorials so far have recommended you vote for Hillary while using all the anti-Trump memes. The latest being the LA Times.</i>

<h2>News Services</h2>

<div class="entity">
<h3>Reuters</h3>
<p>Coverage is anti-trump in general, hidden well so far.</p>
</div>

<div class="entity">
<h3>AP</h3>
<p>A simple reflection of the average journalist supporting Hillary.</p>
</div>
